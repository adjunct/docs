#### Sawmills Overview

Telemetry data—logs, metrics, traces, and events—is exploding in volume, and that brings some serious challenges:

* **Skyrocketing Costs:** Observability is eating up IT budgets, often in unpredictable ways, second only to cloud expenses.
* **Data Headaches:** Keeping data consistent, managing PII, and dealing with ever-changing data sources can be a real pain and a time drain.
