Think of processors as the steps that refine your data, ensuring that only the most relevant information moves forward and that it’s formatted correctly for the systems using it. By using processors, you can enhance, clean, and streamline your data, making it more useful and actionable.

**What Can Processors Do?**

* **Filter Data**: Remove unnecessary or irrelevant data to reduce noise and keep only the information that matters. For example, you might filter out log entries that aren’t errors or strip out specific fields from telemetry data.
* **Enrich Data**: Add valuable context to your data, such as timestamps, metadata, or additional tags that make it easier to analyze later on.
* **Transform Data**: Modify data formats or values to ensure compatibility with your destination systems. This could involve converting metric units, normalizing log levels, or reformatting trace IDs.
* **Aggregate Information**: Combine multiple pieces of data into summaries or statistics, such as calculating the average response time over a period, to provide a high-level view of performance.
