3. **Destination**: Displays the destination of the telemetry data governed by the specific quota.
4. **Usage**: Shows the current usage levels and the data volume relative to the quota limit. Note that this usage is for the current day only.
5. **Quota Status Bar**: Located next to the Usage, this bar indicates the status of the data volume for that quota:  
   * **Dark Red**: Indicates a breach of the quota set.  
   * **Triangle Indicator**: Shows the time of the day when the quota was breached.
6. **Allocated Quota**: Displays the allocated quota limit for that specific quota.
7. **Owner**: Shows the owner responsible for the quota.
8. **Last Updated**: Indicates the last time the quota details were updated.
