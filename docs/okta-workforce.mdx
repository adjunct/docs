#### Create a new enterprise application in Okta

To create a new enterprise application in Okta:

1. Navigate to Okta and sign in.
2. In the Okta dashboard, select Admin in the top right corner.
3. In the navigation sidebar, select the Applications dropdown and select Applications.
4. Select the Create App Integration button.
5. In the Create a new app integration modal, select the SAML 2.0 option and select the Next button.
6. Once redirected to the Create SAML Integration page, fill in the General Settings fields. An App name is required.
7. Select the Next button to continue.

#### Configure your service provider

Once you have moved forward from the General Settings instructions, you will be presented with the Configure SAML page.

To configure your service provider (Sawmills), you must add these two fields to your IdP's application:

* Single sign-on URL - This is your application's URL that your IdP will redirect your users back to after they have authenticated in your IdP.
* Audience URI (SP Entity ID) - This is a unique identifier for your SAML connection that your IdP application needs.

You will need to fill out the appropriate values for these fields. Currently Sawmills does not expose these via the UI, please ask Sawmills support to securely send this to you.

Once you have these, please paste the Single sign-on URL and the Audience URI (SP Entity ID) values into their respective fields.

#### Map Okta claims to Sawmills attributes

Mapping the claims in your IdP to the attributes in Sawmills ensures that the data from your IdP is correctly mapped to the data in Sawmills.

| Sawmills attribute | Okta claim     |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| mail               | user.email     |
| firstName          | user.firstName |
| lastName           | user.lastName  |

1. In the Okta dashboard, find the Attribute Statements (optional) section.
2. For the Name field, enter `mail`.
3. For the Value field, choose `user.email `from the dropdown.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the Next button to continue.
5. You will be redirected to the Feedback page. Fill out the feedback however you would like and select the Finish button to complete the setup.

#### Assign selected user or group in Okta

1. In the Okta dashboard, select the Assignments tab.
2. Select the Assign dropdown. You can either select Assign to people or Assign to groups.
3. In the search field, enter the user or group of users that you want to assign to the enterprise application.
4. Select the Assign button next to the user or group that you want to assign.
5. Select the Done button to complete the assignment.
