Think of a pipeline as a workflow that collects, processes, and sends data wherever you need it. Pipelines help you organize and manage the flow of information, ensuring that data is collected efficiently, transformed as needed, and delivered to the right tools for monitoring, analysis, or storage.

**How Do Pipelines Work?**
A pipeline is made up of a series of connected steps:

* **Source**: The starting point where the data is collected (e.g., logs from your application or metrics from cloud services).
* **Processing**: The middle steps where data can be transformed, filtered, or enriched. This might include adjusting timestamps, aggregating metrics, or removing unnecessary information to reduce noise.
* **Destination**: The endpoint where the processed data is sent, such as a monitoring platform, alerting system, or storage service.

By setting up a pipeline, you create a flow that automates how data is handled from start to finish.
