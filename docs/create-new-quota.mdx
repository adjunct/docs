#### How to Create a Quota Management

To create a quota management, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Quotas** page in your Sawmills account.
2. Locate and click on the **\+ New Quota** button at the top right corner of the page.
3. **Enter a Quota Name**: Begin by providing a name for your quota.
4. **Choose the Type of Telemetry Data**: Select the type of telemetry data you want to set the quota on. Currently, we only support logs. Metrics and tracing are coming soon.
5. **Set Conditions**: Click on **"Condition"** to choose the conditions that must be met for this quota to apply.  
The attributes and values are automatically extracted by the system once telemetry data is going through Sawmills collectors.  
When quota inheritance is defined - conditions from parent quotas are inherited and cannot be removed, but you can add additional conditions to further customize your quota.  
**Note:** IsEmpty operator is catching both empty strings and when attribute does not exist. If you need to catch only empty string please use the regex operator.
1. **Set Quota**: Define the maximum allowed amount of data in GB/day for this quota.  
If the quota you are setting is a parent quota and it has children quotas, you would not be able to allocate less then the sum of the children quotas.  
If the quota you are setting is a child quota, you would not be able to allocate more then the then the parent quota minus the quotas already allocated the sibling quotas.
2. **Set Threshold and Actions**:  
The threshold is defined as a percentage of the daily quota you set. When the threshold is reached, you can choose actions such as:  
**Drop**: Stop sending any more of the data type to the configured destination.  
**Alert**: Receive an email notification indicating the threshold was met.  
You can choose more than one action to be taken when the threshold it reached
3. Once these steps are completed, your quota management will be set up and ready for use. Don't forget to click **"Save"** to ensure everything is applied correctly.
