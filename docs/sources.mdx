They define where the data is coming from—such as applications, databases, cloud services, or infrastructure components—and how it’s collected. When you set up a source, you're telling the system what type of data to collect and from which location or service. Pipelines can have many sources.

**What Can You Do with Sources?**

* **Connect to Different Data Types**: Sources allow you to gather various types of telemetry data, including logs, metrics, and traces. For example, you might set up a source to collect logs from your application or metrics from a Kubernetes cluster.
* **Select Data Collection Methods**: Depending on the source type, different methods can be used to collect data—like HTTP, gRPC, or native integrations with services such as AWS CloudWatch.
