## User Management

### Overview

User Management is a critical feature of our SaaS platform that allows administrators to manage user accounts, permissions, and access levels. It ensures that the right people have the right access to the right resources at the right time, enhancing both security and productivity.

### Features

#### 1\. User Roles and Permissions

User roles define what a user can or cannot do within the platform. Each role comes with a set of permissions that grant or restrict access to specific features or data.

* **Admin**: Has full access to all features, including user management.
* **Member**: Can access and interact with resources according to their permissions.

#### 2\. User Invitation and Enrollment

Our platform provides three methods for inviting and managing new users:

* **No Automatic Enrollment**: Administrators manually invite users by sending invitations through email. Users must accept the invitation to create an account.
* **Automatic Invitations**: New users are automatically invited based on predefined criteria, such as their email domain or membership in an organization.
* **Automatic Suggestions**: The system suggests potential users based on their interactions with the platform. Administrators can review and approve these suggestions to send invitations.

### Getting Started

To begin managing users, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Invitation Method**:  
   * Navigate to the **General** section in the **Organization Profile**.  
   * Select your preferred invitation method (No Automatic Enrollment, Automatic Invitations, or Automatic Suggestions).  
   * Save your settings to ensure the correct method is in place.
2. **Invite Users**:  
   * Go to the **Organization** section and click on **Members**.  
   * Click on "Add Member" to invite new users. Fill in the necessary details, including their email address and role.  
   * Users will receive an invitation via email and must follow the provided instructions to join the platform.
3. **Manage Existing Users**:  
   * View, edit, or remove users from the Members list. You can also adjust roles and permissions as needed.
